# Payment Test Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Rate Limiting**: Tests are failing with 429 (Too Many Requests) errors due to rate limiting in the application
2. **Environment Configuration**: Some tests are expecting specific HTTP status codes but receiving different ones due to environment differences
3. **Missing Dependencies**: Some tests are failing because of missing dependencies like `chai`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Rate Limiting Disabled for Tests
Updated `src/app.js` to conditionally apply rate limiting only in non-test environments:

```javascript
// Conditionally apply rate limiting based on environment
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'test') {
  // Rate limiting code here
}
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Created `.env.test` with appropriate test configurations:

```
NODE_ENV=test
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/gygg-platform-test
JWT_SECRET=test-jwt-secret-key-minimum-32-characters
# ... other configurations
```

### 3. Test Structure
Created comprehensive test files for both Stripe and Nuvei payment implementations:

1. `tests/integration/paymentIntegration.test.js` - Tests for Stripe payment functionality
2. `tests/integration/nuveiPaymentIntegration.test.js` - Tests for Nuvei payment functionality

## Test Coverage

### Stripe Payment Tests
- Payment creation and validation
- Invoice PDF generation
- Balance retrieval
- Withdrawal processing
- Earnings summary
- Payment history

### Nuvei Payment Tests
- Payment creation and validation
- Payment session management
- Withdrawal processing
- Onboarding flow
- Unified payment system integration

## Running Tests

To run the payment tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific payment tests
npm run test:stripe

# Run tests with verbose output
npm test -- --verbose
```

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Fix Missing Dependencies**: Install chai for test assertions:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev chai
   ```

2. **Mock External Services**: Use mocking libraries like `nock` for external API calls to Stripe and Nuvei

3. **Improve Test Isolation**: Ensure each test has proper setup and teardown to avoid interference

4. **Add More Test Cases**: Expand coverage for edge cases and error conditions

5. **Continuous Integration**: Set up CI pipeline to run tests automatically on code changes

## Test Results Analysis

The failing tests show patterns:
- Authentication tests expecting 400 but getting 429 (rate limiting)
- Payment tests expecting 200 but getting 400 (validation errors)
- Some tests expecting 401 but getting 400 (authentication flow issues)

Most of these issues should be resolved by:
1. Disabling rate limiting in test environment
2. Ensuring proper test data setup
3. Fixing authentication flow in tests
4. Installing missing dependencies
