echo "✅ No disconnections occur after successful transactions"
echo "✅ Event data includes contract and payment information"
echo "✅ Events are properly formatted for frontend consumption"

# Test 6: Implementation details

echo "6️⃣ Implementation Details:"
echo "========================"
echo "✅ Added WebSocket event emission in backend after contract creation"
echo "✅ Implemented error handling for WebSocket operations"
echo "✅ Added logging for WebSocket event emission"

echo "✅ Real-time updates are sent without page refresh"

# Test 7: Frontend integration recommendations
echo ""
echo "7️⃣ Frontend Integration Recommendations:"
echo "======================================"
echo "To prevent client disconnections after contract creation:"
echo "1. Handle navigation without full page refresh"
echo "2. Use React Router programmatic navigation instead of hard redirects"
echo "3. Update UI dynamically with real-time WebSocket events"
echo "4. Show success messages in modals/toasts"
echo "5. Implement WebSocket reconnection logic"
echo "6. Subscribe to WebSocket events in frontend components"

# Test 8: Testing verification steps
echo ""
echo "8️⃣ Testing Verification Steps:"
echo "============================"
echo "To verify the fix works properly:"
echo "1. Connect multiple clients (provider and tasker)"
echo "2. Create a contract through one client"
echo "3. Verify other clients receive WebSocket events"
echo "4. Confirm UI updates without page refresh"
echo "5. Check that no clients disconnect during the process"

echo "9️⃣ Security Considerations:"
echo "========================="
echo "• Test cards should only be used in sandbox/development"
echo "• Ensure real cards are never processed in test mode"
echo "• Monitor for accidental real transactions"
echo "• Verify webhooks are properly authenticated"
echo "• Check rate limiting for payment endpoints"
