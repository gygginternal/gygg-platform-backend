# Analysis of the issue
echo "üß© ISSUE ANALYSIS:"
echo "----------------"
echo "‚úÖ Contract creation was SUCCESSFUL"
echo "‚úÖ Database records were created properly"
echo "‚úÖ No backend errors during contract processing"
echo ""
echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  CLIENT DISCONNECTION OCCURRED 6 SECONDS AFTER CONTRACT CREATION"
echo "   This timing suggests:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Frontend navigation after successful response"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Page refresh/reload after contract creation"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ WebSocket connection lost during UI transition"
echo ""

# Common causes
echo "üîç COMMON CAUSES:"
echo "---------------"
echo "1. Frontend redirects to a new page after contract creation"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Page navigation causes WebSocket disconnections"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Clients lose their real-time connection"
echo ""
echo "2. Missing WebSocket event emission after contract creation"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ No real-time notifications sent to connected clients"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Other users don't receive updates about the new contract"
echo ""
echo "3. Frontend doesn't handle WebSocket reconnection properly"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ No automatic reconnection logic implemented"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Authentication state not preserved during reconnection"
echo ""

# Recommended solutions
echo "üîß RECOMMENDED SOLUTIONS:"
echo "----------------------"
echo "1. Emit WebSocket events after contract creation:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ io.to(tasker._id).emit('contract:new', contractData)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ io.to(provider._id).emit('contract:created', contractData)"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ io.to(gig._id).emit('gig:updated', updatedGig)"
echo ""
echo "2. Handle WebSocket reconnection on frontend:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Implement automatic reconnection logic"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Store authentication state for reconnection"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Resume subscriptions after reconnection"
echo ""
echo "3. Use real-time updates instead of page navigation:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Update UI with contract data without refresh"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Show success message in modal/dialog"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Redirect after brief delay to allow events"
echo ""
echo "4. Improve error handling:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Log WebSocket disconnection reasons"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Implement graceful degradation"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Show offline indicators to users"
echo ""

# Verification steps
echo "‚úÖ VERIFICATION STEPS:"
echo "-------------------"
echo "1. Check if frontend navigates after contract creation response"
echo "2. Verify WebSocket event emission in backend after contract creation"
echo "3. Confirm frontend handles WebSocket reconnection properly"
echo "4. Test real-time updates without page refresh"
echo "5. Monitor WebSocket connection status in browser developer tools"
echo ""

# Expected behavior
echo "üéØ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:"
echo "-------------------"
echo "‚úÖ Contract creation succeeds with 200 OK response"
echo "‚úÖ WebSocket events are emitted to notify connected clients"
echo "‚úÖ Frontend updates UI without losing WebSocket connection"
echo "‚úÖ Other users receive real-time notifications"
echo "‚úÖ No client disconnections during normal operation"
echo ""

# Conclusion
echo "üéâ CONCLUSION:"
echo "-------------"
echo "The backend contract creation is WORKING CORRECTLY."
echo "The client disconnections are LIKELY DUE TO FRONTEND NAVIGATION."
echo "Implement WebSocket event emission and proper reconnection handling."
