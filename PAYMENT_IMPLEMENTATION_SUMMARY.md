# Gygg Platform Payment Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Gygg platform has a dual payment system supporting both Stripe (global) and Nuvei (Canadian market focused) payment providers. This allows the platform to operate in both international and Canadian markets with appropriate payment solutions for each region.

## Architecture

### Dual Payment Systems
1. **Stripe Payment System**
   - Global payment processing in USD
   - Card payments for providers worldwide
   - Payouts to taskers via Stripe Connect
   - Automatic tax calculation through Stripe Tax

2. **Nuvei Payment System**
   - Canadian market-focused payment processing in CAD
   - Card payments via Nuvei Simply Connect
   - InstaDebit bank transfers for Canadian users
   - Direct bank transfers to Canadian accounts

### Core Components

#### Models
1. **Payment.js** - Stripe payment model
2. **NuveiPayment.js** - Nuvei payment model
3. **User.js** - Extended with payment-related fields for both systems

#### Services
1. **StripePaymentService.js** - Handles Stripe payment operations
2. **NuveiPaymentService.js** - Manages Nuvei payment processing
3. **NuveiPayoutService.js** - Handles Nuvei withdrawal/bank transfer operations
4. **AggregatedPaymentService.js** - Unified dashboard functionality

#### Controllers
1. **paymentController.js** - Main payment orchestration
2. **nuveiPaymentController.js** - Nuvei-specific payment handling

#### Routes
1. **paymentRoutes.js** - Main payment API endpoints
2. **nuveiPaymentRoutes.js** - Nuvei-specific API endpoints

## Fee Structure Implementation

### Revenue Model
- **Tasker receives**: Full agreed service amount (no deductions)
- **Platform receives**: Percentage-based fee + fixed fee
- **Provider pays**: Service amount + platform fee + applicable taxes

### Fee Calculations
```javascript
// Service amount (what tasker receives - the agreed upon amount)
const agreedServiceAmount = this.amount;

// Platform fee calculation (percentage of service amount + fixed fee)
// This fee goes to the platform as revenue
const applicationFeeAmount = Math.round(agreedServiceAmount * feePercentage) + fixedFeeCents;

// Provider pays tax on the total amount they pay (service + platform fee)
const providerTaxableAmount = agreedServiceAmount + applicationFeeAmount;
const providerTaxAmount = Math.round(providerTaxableAmount * taxPercent);

// Total tax amount (only provider tax in this model)
const taxAmount = providerTaxAmount;

// Total amount provider pays (service amount + platform fee + tax)
const totalProviderPayment = agreedServiceAmount + applicationFeeAmount + providerTaxAmount;

// Amount tasker receives (the full agreed service amount - no fees deducted)
const amountReceivedByPayee = agreedServiceAmount;
```

### Environment Configuration
- `PLATFORM_FIXED_FEE_CENTS`: Fixed platform fee ($5.00 default)
- `PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENT`: Percentage fee (10% default)
- `TAX_PERCENT`: Tax percentage (13% default)

## Key Features

### 1. Complete System Separation
- Independent models for Stripe (`Payment`) and Nuvei (`NuveiPayment`)
- Independent processing logic for each system
- Unified interface with method selection
- Separate fee structures per system

### 2. Unified Dashboard Experience
- Single view showing payments from both Stripe and Nuvei systems
- Role-based filtering (tasker/provider perspectives)
- Consistent data formatting regardless of payment system
- Cross-system analytics and statistics

### 3. Independent Payout Flows
- Stripe withdrawals for USD payments
- Nuvei bank transfers for CAD payments
- Native currency support (USD for Stripe, CAD for Nuvei)
- Market-adapted payment processing for Canadian users

### 4. Enhanced Security & Compliance
- Proper authorization for all payment operations
- Complete data isolation between payment systems
- Audit trails for all payment activities
- Comprehensive error handling for both systems

## API Endpoints

### Payment Processing
- `POST /api/v1/payments/contracts/:contractId/create-payment-intent` (Stripe)
- `POST /api/v1/payments/nuvei/create-session` (Nuvei)
- `POST /api/v1/payments/contracts/:contractId/create-nuvei-payment` (Nuvei)

### Consolidated Dashboard
- `GET /api/v1/payments/unified-history` - Combined payment history
- `GET /api/v1/payments/consolidated-summary` - Earnings summary across systems
- `GET /api/v1/payments/statistics` - Cross-system statistics
- `GET /api/v1/payments/cross-system/:system/:paymentId` - Specific payment details

### Withdrawal Functionality
- `POST /api/v1/payments/withdraw` - Enhanced with `paymentMethod` parameter ('stripe' or 'nuvei')
- `GET /api/v1/payments/nuvei-withdrawal-history` - Nuvei-specific history
- `GET /api/v1/payments/balances` - Unified balance checking across both systems

### User Management
- `POST /api/v1/payments/create-connected-account` - Stripe account setup
- `POST /api/v1/payments/initiate-account-session` - Stripe onboarding
- `POST /api/v1/payments/nuvei/start-onboarding` - Nuvei onboarding
- User profile includes both Stripe and Nuvei-specific fields for setup tracking

## Test Issues and Recommendations

### Current Issues
1. **Rate Limiting**: Tests are failing with 429 (Too Many Requests) errors
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Some tests require `chai` which is not installed
3. **Incorrect Test Syntax**: Some tests use chai syntax instead of Jest
4. **Import Errors**: Some tests have incorrect import paths

### Recommendations for Fixes

#### 1. Install Missing Dependencies
```bash
npm install --save-dev chai
```

#### 2. Fix Rate Limiting in Test Environment
Update `src/app.js` to conditionally apply rate limiting:
```javascript
// Conditionally apply rate limiting based on environment
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'test') {
  // Rate limiting code here
}
```

#### 3. Fix Test Syntax
Convert chai-style assertions to Jest-style:
```javascript
// Change from:
expect(payment.amount).to.equal(10000);

// To:
expect(payment.amount).toBe(10000);
```

#### 4. Fix Import Paths
Ensure all import paths are correct and use relative paths appropriately.

#### 5. Fix Test Files
Update failing test files to use proper Jest syntax and fix import issues.

## Implementation Status
The payment system is largely implemented with:
- Complete dual payment system architecture
- Unified dashboard for cross-system payments
- Proper fee and tax calculations
- Extensive error handling
- Well-structured codebase

However, some tests need to be fixed to properly validate the implementation.
