# Gygg Platform - Separated Payment System Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete implementation of a separated payment system for the Gygg platform, enabling independent processing through both Stripe (global) and Nuvei (Canadian market focused) payment providers while maintaining a unified user experience.

---

## Phase 1: Payment System Separation

### Objective
Create completely independent payment processing systems for Stripe and Nuvei while maintaining a unified dashboard experience.

### Implementation

#### 1. Nuvei Payment Model (`src/models/NuveiPayment.js`)
- Created separate payment model specifically for Nuvei transactions
- Included all Nuvei-specific fields (session IDs, transaction IDs, etc.)
- Maintained identical fee calculation structure as Stripe for consistency
- Added support for both card payments and bank transfers (InstaDebit)

#### 2. User Model Enhancements (`src/models/User.js`)
- Added Nuvei-specific user fields:
  - `nuveiAccountId`, `nuveiCustomerId`
  - `nuveiVerificationStatus`, `nuveiBankToken`
  - `nuveiPaymentMethods` (array of available payment methods)
  - `nuveiBankTransferEnabled` (flag for bank transfer capability)
  - `nuveiBankDetails` (nested object with account/institution/transit numbers)

#### 3. Nuvei Payment Service (`src/services/payment/NuveiPaymentService.js`)
- Complete service layer for Nuvei operations
- Payment session creation with proper fee calculations
- Transaction verification and confirmation
- User payment history retrieval
- Earnings summary by role (tasker/provider)

#### 4. Controller Updates (`src/controllers/paymentController.js`)
- Updated Nuvei functions to use the new service layer
- Maintained existing Stripe functionality
- Proper separation of concerns

---

## Phase 2: Consolidated Dashboard APIs

### Objective
Create APIs to provide users with a consolidated view showing earnings/spending from both Stripe and Nuvei payment methods.

### Implementation

#### 1. Aggregated Payment Service (`src/services/payment/AggregatedPaymentService.js`)
- **Unified Payment History**: Fetch and combine payments from both Stripe and Nuvei systems
- **Consolidated Earnings Summary**: Show earnings/spending across both payment methods
- **Payment Statistics**: Aggregate statistics from both systems
- **Cross-system Query Support**: Query capabilities spanning both payment providers
- **Consistent Data Formatting**: Standardized response format regardless of payment system

#### 2. Payment Aggregation Controller (`src/controllers/paymentAggregationController.js`)
- `getUnifiedPaymentHistory`: Returns combined payment history from both systems
- `getConsolidatedEarningsSummary`: Provides consolidated earnings view by role
- `getPaymentStatistics`: Aggregated statistics across both systems
- `getCrossSystemPaymentDetails`: Get details for a specific payment regardless of system

#### 3. Enhanced Payment Routes (`src/routes/paymentRoutes.js`)
Added new endpoints for unified dashboard functionality:
- `GET /api/v1/payments/unified-history` - Unified payment history
- `GET /api/v1/payments/consolidated-summary` - Consolidated earnings summary
- `GET /api/v1/payments/statistics` - Cross-system statistics
- `GET /api/v1/payments/cross-system/:system/:paymentId` - Specific payment details

#### 4. New Routes File (`src/routes/paymentAggregationRoutes.js`)
- Dedicated routes file for aggregation endpoints
- Proper protection and validation middleware

## Phase 3: Independent Payout Flows

### Objective
Create completely independent payout flows for each system while maintaining the unified dashboard experience.

### Implementation

#### 1. Nuvei Payout Service (`src/services/payment/NuveiPayoutService.js`)
- **Nuvei Withdrawal Processing**: Handles direct bank transfers via Nuvei for Canadian taskers
- **Balance Calculation**: Calculates available balance from Nuvei payments and withdrawals
- **Withdrawal History**: Tracks and retrieves Nuvei-specific withdrawal history
- **Webhook Handling**: Processes Nuvei payout confirmations
- **Bank Transfer Integration**: Supports InstaDebit and direct CAD bank transfers

#### 2. Enhanced Withdrawal Controller (`src/controllers/paymentController.js`)
- **Multi-Method Withdrawals**: Supports both Stripe (USD) and Nuvei (CAD) withdrawals via `paymentMethod` parameter
- **Balance Checking**: Unified balance checking across both systems with `GET /balances` endpoint
- **Nuvei Withdrawal History**: Dedicated endpoint for Nuvei withdrawal history
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing Stripe withdrawals continue to work unchanged

#### 3. User Model Updates (`src/models/User.js`)
- Added Nuvei bank transfer specific fields:
  - `nuveiBankTransferEnabled` (flag for capability)
  - `nuveiBankTransferSetupCompletedAt` (setup tracking)
  - `nuveiLastWithdrawalAttempt` (withdrawal tracking)
  - `nuveiTotalWithdrawn` (total withdrawal tracking)
  - `nuveiPreferredWithdrawalMethod` (preference setting)

#### 4. Updated Payment Routes (`src/routes/paymentRoutes.js`)
- `POST /withdraw` - Enhanced with `paymentMethod` parameter ('stripe' or 'nuvei')
- `GET /nuvei-withdrawal-history` - Dedicated Nuvei withdrawal history endpoint
- `GET /balances` - Unified balance checking across both systems

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Complete System Separation
- **Independent Models**: Separate `Payment` (Stripe) and `NuveiPayment` models
- **Independent Processing**: Each system processes payments independently
- **Unified Interface**: Single API surface with method selection
- **Separate Fee Structures**: Independent fee calculation per system

### 2. Unified Dashboard Experience
- **Single View**: Consolidated dashboard showing payments from both systems
- **Role-Based Filtering**: Proper earnings vs spending views based on user role
- **Consistent Formatting**: Standardized response format regardless of payment system
- **Cross-System Analytics**: Combined statistics and metrics

### 3. Independent Payout Systems
- **Stripe Withdrawals**: Traditional USD payouts to connected Stripe accounts
- **Nuvei Withdrawals**: Direct CAD bank transfers to Canadian banks via InstaDebit
- **Native Currency Support**: USD for Stripe, CAD for Nuvei
- **Market Adaptation**: Native support for Canadian payment preferences

### 4. Enhanced Security & Compliance
- **Proper Authorization**: Role-based access controls maintained
- **Data Isolation**: Complete separation of payment data between systems
- **Audit Trails**: Independent tracking and logging for each system
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for both systems

## New API Endpoints

### Payment Processing
- `POST /api/v1/payments/contracts/:contractId/create-payment-intent` (Stripe)
- `POST /api/v1/payments/nuvei/create-session` (Nuvei)
- `POST /api/v1/payments/contracts/:contractId/create-nuvei-payment` (Nuvei)

### Consolidated Dashboard
